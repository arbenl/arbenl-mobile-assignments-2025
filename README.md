## üìò How to use these assignments as a student

- **Explore the catalog:** Review all 60 topics in `TOPICS.md` and shortlist the ideas that fit your interests or portfolio goals.
- **Assess feasibility:** Compare the suggested Supabase schema and tooling with your existing skills to decide what you need to learn or prototype first.
- **Claim responsibly:** Once confident, follow the claiming workflow above so the topic is reserved in your name.
- **Plan your build:** Break the requirements into weekly milestones, documenting them in your own project board or tracker before you start coding.
- **Leverage AI effectively:** Keep a running `AI-log.txt` that records meaningful prompts and outputs you used for ideation, debugging, or asset creation.
- **Iterate and test:** Develop the app incrementally, demoing features on a device/emulator and validating Supabase integration as you go.
- **Reflect and share:** When finished, publish a concise case study or README section explaining what you built, challenges faced, and what you learned.
